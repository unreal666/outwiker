<h1>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h1>
<h3>OutWiker does not run under Windows. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Try to install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en">MS Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package</a>.If you install the library and it did not help, please write to the author on <a href="http://jenyay.net/Soft/Outwiker">program page</a> or write to e-mail <a href="mailto:jenyay.ilin@gmail.com">jenyay.ilin@gmail.com</a> with a full error text.</p>
<h3>May it be better to make the program keep notes in one file?</h3>
<p>Keeping notes in a tree - the main feature, for which the program was developed. This does not mean that someday I will not add the option for choosing ways of storing your notes, but this will not happen in the near future.</p>
<h3>Will there be a visual editor for the pages?</h3>
<p>There are some thoughts to make a separate page type format RichTextFormat with the visual editor. Please do not exclude the possibility that there will be a visual editor for HTML-pages. But still I can't talk about dates.</p>
