Additional plugins can be found [[here -> http://jenyay.net/Outwiker/Plugins]].

To install the plug-ins need to unzip the plugin archive to ''plugins'' folder next to the outwiker.exe (if you run OutWiker in portable mode) or to ''outwiker\plugins'' directory of the user's settings folder (under Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 - {+C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\outwiker\plugins+}, under Linux - {+/home/USERNAME/.config/outwiker/plugins+}). The easiest way to open the plugin folder is select "Help - Open Plugins Folder" menu item.

If you write your own plugin and you want it to be posted on the page of plugins, send it to email [[mailto: jenyay.ilin @ gmail.com | jenyay.ilin @ gmail.com]] with a detailed description.
