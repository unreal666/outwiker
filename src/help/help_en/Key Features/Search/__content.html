<p>Search in the program is implemented as a separate type of page that can be placed anywhere in a tree. Search page is created in the same way as the other pages, but there is an easier way to create, on which the tell later. Such representation of search can be useful if you often look for the same phrase. You can create multiple pages for each search phrase and the program will remember what you're looking for with each of these pages.</p>
<p>You can search both by the contents page and by tag. If you do not enter the search phrase, the search will be carried out only on the tags, and you can choose the page should contain all the marked tag or at least one of them.</p>
<p>If no tags are not selected, tags are ignored by a search. If you leave the field of the search phrase empty and does not mention a any tag, it displays all pages in the tree.</p>
<p>A simplified way to create search pages is that when you first touch of a button or menu item "Tools - Global search ..." will be created and immediately selected search page with the name "# Search".</p>
