!!! Add tags to your notes 

Each note may be added any number of tags, which can then be used to find specific notes.

Tags may be added to the notes in several ways. First, you can add when you create a note. At the same tags must be separated by commas.

To facilitate the input of the existing tags, you can use the tag cloud below the input field. When you click on the tag, it will be added in the input field. Tags can be edited after you create notes with a similar dialogue, which is called by menu item "Tree - Page Properties...".

Tags can be added and from the main window without causing the page properties. For this purpose the panel "Tags" in the main window. If the "tags" window is hidden, it can be opened using the menu item "View - Tags."

When you click the middle mouse button label, by appropriate tag is added to the note or removed from it, depending on whether or not this tag is previously installed. Background tags assigned to the selected page is highlighted in color (yellow by default).

On the "Tags" panel font size for each label depends on the count of use of the tags of all the notes (the more popular the tag, the more it appears large font).

When you click on tag the left mouse button displays a list of pages that are also marked this tag.
