[[#using]]
!!! Using

ThumbGallery plugin adds a command [= (:thumbgallery:) =] into the wiki notation. This command can operate in two modes: show all attached images or only selected files. To facilitate the use of commands when you click on the plugin button Attach:gallery.png (or by selecting the appropriate menu item) to open the dialog shown in the following figure:

%center%Attach:gallery_dialog.jpeg

The syntax of the command [= (:thumbgallery:) =] to show all attached images as follows:

[=(:thumbgallery [params]:)=]

[= (:thumbgallery:) =] command can take the following parameters:

* ''cols = ...'' An integer value. The number of columns in the table. If ''cols = 0'' or not specified, then the gallery will be a sequence of thumbnails without splitting into rows and columns.

* ''px = ...'' An integer value. Specifies the size of the thumbnails (on the larger side). If ''px = 0'', or the parameter is not specified, the default value from the program settings.

In the gallery you can also place the selected images, this is the following syntax:

[=
(:thumbgallery [params]:)
[Attach:]picture_1 [| Comment]
[Attach:]picture_2 [| Comment]
...
(:thumbgalleryend:)
=]

Possible parameters in this case are the same as described above. Comments on the use of images is not required. Also, do not necessarily write [=Attach:=] before the file name.

[[#extra]]
!!! For more information

Plugin ThumbGallery created so that where possible, have the syntax compatibility with the plugin [[http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/ThumbList | ThumbList]] for pmWiki. I will not go into details of the plug-in, except to say that it adds two commands [= (:thumblist:) =] to create a gallery of all pictures, and [= (:thumbgallery:) =] to create a gallery of selected images. As I tried to plugin ThumbGallery combine these commands into one, but added a synonym for the command [= (:thumbgallery:) =] - [= (:thumblist:) =]. Thus, wherever it is written [= (:thumbgallery:) =] you can use [= (:thumblist:) =].

I thought that the name of the parameter ''px'' not very informative, so I added it a synonym for - ''maxsize'', by analogy with the same parameter when creating a thumbnail.

The [= (:thumbgallery:) =] command can be used in the form [= (:thumbgallery:) =], as well as [= (:thumbgallery:) ... (:thumbgalleryend:) =]. If a page is to use this command on both accounts, then the parser will have problems with the definition of the end of the command [= (:thumbgallery:) =]. In this case, you can do in two ways:

# For all galleries uses, non-closable command the notation [= (:thumblist:) =], but for all the galleries with individual images to use the recording [= (: thumbgallery :) ... (: thumbgalleryend :) =]. Or vice versa.

# Always use a closing command [= (:thumbgallery:)(:thumbgalleryend:) =]. Take care to ensure that between the opening and closing command are no spaces, otherwise it will be seen as creating a gallery with no images. It's not a bug, it was made specifically to be able to hide the gallery if necessary, without removing the entire team.

Enjoy the use of plugin!
